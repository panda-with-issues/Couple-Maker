# Couple Maker

## Aim

Couple Maker a simple web app used to pair people out of a group. After having collected informations, the app outputs a random generated list of couples. If called again, the app generates a new list of couples, but avoiding pairs that were generated in previous call.
This app is aimed for event such speed-dating, in which you need people to speak with each other in pairs and then switch partner.

## Maintenance

Couple Maker is written for an event organized by Associazione Studentesca Universitaria Iris, a student association of University of Udine, Italy. Thus the UI is entirely in Italian and such will remain. However, if you need help with translation, just contact me.

Because of the very specific use intended for this app, I won't mantain it. If you find any bug, please report it and, according to my spare time, I'll try to fix it.
